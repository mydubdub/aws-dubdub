## 1. Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a telemedicine solution for remote area that has a prevalence of high heart diseases by performing a pre-screening using Dub-Dub.

## 2. Propose System Design

The purpose of this research is to develop a virtual access system on cloud environment which can be accessed by users through any internet-based platform, including smartphone or computer. The developed cloud system can handle ECG data transmission from a wearable ECG device worn by patients at a rural public health center to a cloud storage or database for storing the recorded data. Afterwards, the recorded data is conveyed to the previously developed web application in virtual private server to extract important parameters to detect cardiac arrhythmias. In this stage, the processes are done completely on cloud environment. Next, a cardiologist at a district hospital accesses the web application through virtual private server to obtain the computed data. As a result, the cardiologist can provide virtual diagnosis back to the patient at rural public health center based on the computed data. { text-align: justify; }

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mydubdub/aws-dubdub/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
